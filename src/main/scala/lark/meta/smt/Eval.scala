  /** Generate a bunch of traces from the SMT solver.
   *
   * This just asks the SMT solver to return traces of increasing length. There
   * are no constraints to ask for "interesting" traces. In practice Z3 does
   * seem to choose values that reach different states, but there isn't much
   * variation. A lot of the values are zero, so I wonder whether there's a
   * sort of soft constraint that tries to bring them down to zero.
   *
   * LODO: generate more interesting traces. One idea might be to generate a
   * random value for each input argument, and constrain them with soft
   * assertions. We could also add soft assertions that the states should be
   * distinct. Z3 supports soft assertions, but I don't think CVC5 does.
