/**
 * Equivalence graphs based on the egg paper:
 *  egg: Fast and extensible equality saturation,
 *  Willsey, Nandi, Wang, Flatt, Tatlock, Panchekha, 2020.
 *  https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03082.pdf
 *
 * Equivalence graphs describe equivalences between sets of terms such that
 * the graph is always closed under congruence. You can apply rewrite rules to
 * expand the equivalences and then extract information about which terms are
 * equivalent.
 * The key contributions of the egg paper are splitting out the invariant
 * maintenance to an explicit rebuild step, and adding a framework for e-class
 * analyses. We only implement the first (explicit rebuild) here yet, but the
 * analyses would be useful for constant folding at least.
 *
 * To implement this I also referred to the Python reference implementation at
 *  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tNOQijJqe5tw-Pk9iqd6HHb2abC5aRid?usp=sharing
 * (I'm not sure who the author is, or whether it's an official reference)
 * I'd recommend reading the paper for an overview, then looking at the Python
 * reference implementation. The reference code in the paper has a few
 * omissions. The Rust code is written for performance and supports a few other
 * features (analysis, explanations) so is a bit more complicated.
