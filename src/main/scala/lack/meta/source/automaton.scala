/** Syntactic sugar for describing automata.
 *
 * The automata are loosely inspired by the paper "A conservative extension
 * of synchronous data-flow with state machines" (Colaço 2005), but I haven't
 * implemented the "last" operator or weak "until" transitions yet.
 * Parameterised state machines would be quite useful too ("Mixing signals
 * and modes in synchronous data-flow systems", Colaço 2006) and seem doable.
 *
 * I'm not convinced that the semantics in either of these papers are totally
 * correct though - weak "until" resets seem to only reset the strong
 * transition (the "unless" part), rather than the main part of the state.
 *
 * The user is expected to create a node that inherits from this class and
 * define named local state objects that inherit from Automaton.State. Each
 * state object defines its transitions and bindings. The user must specify
 * the initial state by calling initial(state) from their automaton's
 * constructor.
 *
 * Too much magic?
 *
 * OPTIMISE: looking at the core program, the main difference between my
 * hand-written automaton and the generated one is that this generated one
 * has lots of resets. each state has two reset contexts, one for resetting
 * the transitions, and one for resetting the state bindings. we should be
 * able to figure out ahead-of-time which states are actually restarted, and
 * only introduce reset contexts for those.
 * The automata translations described in "a conservative extension"
 * (Colaço 2005) and "hierarchical state machines as modular horn clauses"
 * (Garoche 2016) don't make it statically clear which states can reset and
 * which cannot, either. I wonder whether this was one of the issues that
 * made Kind2's automata a bit slow, if reset contexts introduce extra copies
 * of the state there too.
