  /** Mark an expression as an argument to a subnode.
   *
   * If you have a node you want to call which looks something like:
   * > class SoFar(e: Stream[Bool]) extends Node
   * then you might try to call it from another node as:
   * > SoFar(x > 5)
   *
   * However, the problem with the above call is that the subnode gets directly
   * instantiated with any occurrences of e replaced with the value `x > 5`,
   * losing the fact that e referred to the first parameter. This substitution
   * makes it hard to do modular proofs: if SoFar has some local propositions
   * that we'd like to prove, but all we have is a few different instances of
   * SoFar with different arguments, then it becomes hard to know which parts
   * of the proof can be reused across the different instances.
   * Copilot has a similar problem with this "eager substitution", which is why
   * they don't support contracts for modular proofs.
   *
   * We get around this by requiring the invocation to explicitly mark the
   * parameters that will be substituted for argument values. We bundle this up
   * inside a "Invocation" object which is passed to the Node base class
   * like so:
   * > class SoFar(e: Stream[Bool], invocation: Invocation) extends Node(invocation)
   *
   * Then, you can call it by calling builder.invoke:
   * > def sofar(e: Stream[Bool])(using builder: Builder): SoFar =
   * >  builder.invoke { invocation =>
   * >    new SoFar(invocation.stream("e", e))
   * >  }
   *
   * This requires some extra boilerplate for each node definition. In the future
   * it should be relatively straightforward to have a macro generate these invocations
   * from the class constructor.
